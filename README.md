# Computer Store App - Assignment 1

## Background

This project is a small bank and salary application where an user can by a pc by earning an amount of salary and put it in the bank.
Salary is set to a 28000kr as a default, but it can be increased by 100kr on pressing the "Work" button. Users can also get a loan by
pressing the "Get a Loan" button, where the Loan can not be greater then the double of the salary balance. Then the second part of the
application is to buy a PC from the bank balance. If the user simply not have enough bank balance, then they should earn money/get loan.
The PCs are from an external API which provides a JSON file from Noroffs heroku application. These PCs can be selected from a dropdown/
select menu. Upon selecting a PC a new field of PC information shows up and changing PCs will change the content of these information fields.
